# Simplicity

The project emphasizes simplicity in both implementation and user experience, as described in [Beforest Bespoke Engine Documentation.md](mdc:Beforest Bespoke Engine Documentation.md):

- Minimal tech stack for rapid deployment and reliability
- Straightforward assessment workflow (session creation, question answering, feedback)
- Automated operations via webhooks
- Clear, concise UI with minimal distractions

Refer to the documentation for examples and rationale.
