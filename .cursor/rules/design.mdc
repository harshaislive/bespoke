# Design

The UI and UX design principles are detailed in [Beforest Bespoke Engine Documentation.md](mdc:Beforest Bespoke Engine Documentation.md) and visual brand guidelines in [brand_doc.md](mdc:brand_doc.md):

- User-centric, step-by-step assessment flow
- Clean, modern interface with clear navigation (question navigation, timer, summary)
- Responsive design for usability across devices
- Emphasis on clarity, feedback, and ease of use

## Brand Guidelines (see [brand_doc.md](mdc:brand_doc.md))
- **Logo:** Use only approved logo, scale appropriately, do not distort or alter colors/effects. Logo: https://beforest.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/23-Beforest-Black-with-Tagline.png
- **Color Palette:** Use primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors as specified. Pair colors as recommended.
- **Typography:** Use ABC Arizona Flare (Serif) for headlines and ABC Arizona Flare (Sans Serif) for body/UI, following the type hierarchy.
- **Visual Style:** Assertive, authentic, approachableâ€”deep earthy tones, muted natural colors, balanced for accessibility.

Refer to [brand_doc.md](mdc:brand_doc.md) for full details and updates on brand identity.
