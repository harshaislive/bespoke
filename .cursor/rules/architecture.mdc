# Architecture

The architecture is modular and event-driven, as described in [Beforest Bespoke Engine Documentation.md](mdc:Beforest Bespoke Engine Documentation.md):

- **Frontend**: SPA (React) interacts with Supabase for data and authentication
- **Backend**: Supabase handles database, auth, storage, and real-time updates
- **Webhooks**: Used for question generation and email delivery, triggered by database events
- **Database Schema**: Users, Sessions, Feedback tables with clear relationships
- **Security**: Row-Level Security (RLS) and Supabase Auth for access control

See the documentation for schema diagrams, workflow, and event triggers.
