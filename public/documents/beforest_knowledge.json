      "whyWeBe": "There was a time before the Earth's green spaces were taken over by glass and concrete. A time when our ancestors lived off the land, gave back to the land, and handed down the land richer and greener than they inherited it. We at Beforest have found a way to recreate that time, for the few who believe that this was a better way to live.",
      "whatWeBelieve": "We believe that there is nothing in nature as resilient as nature itself. And yet, today, nature needs helping hands to put back in nature's bank what generations before us have taken on loan, to restore the green wealth meant for our future generations to enjoy.",

When life's basic needs-clean air, clean water and good food-have become a struggle, then something fundamental has broken down in the design.",
